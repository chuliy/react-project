Hello!

This is a small project that we did to study react. It contains 3 main pages: ListPage, EditPage, CreatePage.

ListPage : Displays all items added on the "CreatePage" page. There is sorting and filtering.

EditPage: Displays all items added on the "CreatePage" page. It is possible to edit and delete the item. Added the ability to filter products in real time.

CreatePage: This is where product cards are created that are displayed on other pages.
